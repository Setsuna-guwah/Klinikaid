# KlinikAid — Web Portal

**An AI-Assisted Web Platform for Automated Inquiry and Record Management**
Capstone project by **Healthioneers** · Client: **Bloodcare Medical Laboratory**, Rodriguez, Rizal

KlinikAid is a multi-role internal clinic management web portal. It centralizes patient queue management, document validation, departmental record entry, descriptive analytics, and a RAG-grounded AI chatbot for clinic inquiries — built for the staff and patients of a DOH-licensed diagnostic laboratory.

> This repository contains the **web portal** only. The companion mobile app (OCR scanning, patient mobile client) is maintained separately.

## User Roles

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, npm, a Supabase project, a Gemini API key.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Klinikaid
npm install
```

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your own values.
2. Apply the SQL files in `src/lib/db/` (`schema.sql`, then migrations in order) via the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The portal runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run build   # production build
```
